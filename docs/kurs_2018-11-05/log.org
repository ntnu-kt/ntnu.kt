* Progress
** 10-31 Wednesday
Small attempt at getting a package to pypi. Following the [[https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html][python packaging]] guide
linked from python.org stopped working at ~python setup.py register~.
*** Trying to get on pypi
- I think Anaconda may be giving me weird versions of things.
  - I could try to use conda instead of pip
  - But will I be able to install packages live, from a notebook, if I deploy to
    anaconda?
- I have a working example on my home computer, of the hotload code.
  - I could wait and go that route.

Progress: I had pip 10.0.1. I installed 18.1 now: ~pip install --user --upgrade
pip~. Result: No change.
** 11-05 Monday
Course done.

1. Was fast
2. Didn't get the module working. Package declarations?
   - Yup. Package declarations. =setup.py= needs to define all packages. A
     package is a "folder"; somewhere there needs to be an =__init__.py= file.
3. Talked to Karl
