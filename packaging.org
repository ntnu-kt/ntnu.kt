* Package and push to pypi
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rm -rf dist
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
#+END_SRC
* Install package from pypi
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install --user ntnu.kt
#+END_SRC
* Install package for local development
Why would you need this? When devloping the package, it's useful to be able to
treat it as a proper package, that is imported normally. Installation for local
development allows this without repackaging every time. 

In the project directory, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install --user --editable .
#+END_SRC

=--user= installs to ~/.local, so that you don't mess with your system wide
python installation. =--editable= is the magic sauce that gives "live" linking
-- when you import the package from somewhere else now, you'll get a link
directly to the source. So that when you do some editing of the source, the next
run will use the updated source.
