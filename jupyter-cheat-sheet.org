Cheat sheet: useful hotkeys when working with Jupyter.

NTNU, Konstruksjonsteknikk 2018-10-05.

** Start jupyter
- Command line option: run ~jupyter lab~ from folder where you want notebooks stored.
- Graphical option: start Jupyter Lab from the start menu or launcher icon
** Notebook hotkeys
I frequently use these shortcuts:

| ~Esc~                     | Focus document, stop writing inside code block.         |
| ~Enter~                   | Focus code block                                        |
| ~Up~ / ~Down~             | Navigate to block above or below                        |
| ~a~                       | Insert block above                                      |
| ~b~                       | Insert block below                                      |
| ~dd~                      | Delete cell(s)                                          |
| ~Shift+Up~ / ~Shift+Down~ | Extend selection up/down                                |
| ~Ctrl+Shift+C~            | View and run any command                                |
| ~Y~                       | Change to Code cell (Python)                            |
| ~M~                       | Change to Markdown cell (for text, images and formulas) |
| ~Ctrl+Enter~              | Evaluate cell                                           |
| ~Shift+Enter~             | Evaluate cell and create new cell below                 |
